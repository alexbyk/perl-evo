=head2 SYNOPSIS
This class exists for internal purposes only to make C<d_resolve> a little bit
simpler. Probably, you're looking for C<::Deferred>

False value of C<blocking> means we're in the async level should call *_continue
to start traverse. True value means we're already in the current C<d_resolve> loop


=head2 try_thenable

You should check C<should_resolve> after invocation and ONLY if it's true,
continue the loop in C<d_resolve>, or break it otherwise.

Because true value means blocking C<resolve> was called with C<v> and we need extra loop,
because C<blocking> resolve dosn't call C<d_resolve> (but blocking C<reject> calls C<d_reject>)
