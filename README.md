# Evo - the next generation component-oriented development framework [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alexbyk/perl-evo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alexbyk/perl-evo)

# DESCRIPTION

This framowerk opens new age of perl programming
It provides rewritten and postmodern features like

- Rewritten sexy [Evo::Export](https://metacpan.org/pod/Evo::Export)
- Post modern component oriented programming [Evo::Comp](https://metacpan.org/pod/Evo::Comp) instead of OO
- (no docs yet) Fast Event-Loop [Evo::Loop](https://metacpan.org/pod/Evo::Loop) with unique feature zones (Not ready)
- (no docs yet) Fast non recursive [Evo::Promises](https://metacpan.org/pod/Evo::Promises), 100% Promises/Spec A compatible
- (no docs yet) Interesting [Evo::Realm](https://metacpan.org/pod/Evo::Realm) design pattern, which is as handy as "Singleton" but without Sintleton's flaws.
It makes real thing that are considered impossible in other languages. For example, testing EventLoop timers without patching, separating flows for one loop and so on.
(ready but experimental and not documented)
- Exception handling in pure perl: [Evo::Eval](https://metacpan.org/pod/Evo::Eval), "try catch" alternative. Like `Try::Tiny`, but without it's bugs and much faster
- [Evo::Ee](https://metacpan.org/pod/Evo::Ee) - a component role that gives your component "EventEmitter" abilities
